Origami is a library built on top of Elixir/Phoenix that facilates the development of UI driven by websocket.
It differs from LiveView by being more client-side centric, where js is compilated from template as does Svelte.
No virtual DOM is involved, only state change is tracked and triggers DOM updates.

**Be careful that this project is still in a very early stage of development**

Any contributions are welcome!
